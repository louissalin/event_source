updating domain:
    Google protocol-buffers for serializing messages. Allows for free renaming of event fields
    Use EventUpdater classes to filter event stream. They can upgrade, split, merge events
    Add entity type to event class so we can check for existing uids and blow up if we're trying to update an entity of a different type than one that's stored already with the same uid.

optimizations:
    insert all events in one go when saving multiple events instead of inserting them in the db one at a time
