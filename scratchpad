updating domain:
    Google protocol-buffers for serializing messages. Allows for free renaming of event fields
    Use EventUpdater classes to filter event stream. They can upgrade, split, merge events

optimizations:
    insert all events in one go when saving multiple events instead of inserting them in the db one at a time
