improvements:
  save events in batch, by entity_type so we don't query the entity's version when saving every event
    add message queue and publish messages when events are triggered
    add more storage options
    rolling snapshots
    use event store as a queue
        add sequence_number to events table, auto-inc
        create process that asynchronously polls the queue for new events (using sequence_number) and publishes them

updating domain:
    Google protocol-buffers for serializing messages. Allows for free renaming of event fields
    Use EventUpdater classes to filter event stream. They can upgrade, split, merge events
